# Markov

By looking at all the n-grams, we are able to use that and the markov chain theory to predict what will come after some given words. This will produce tone-like text that matches the data given. For example, we provided the Shakespeared poems and literatures, the output text will sound like Shakespeare's literature

## How to Use

In the `markov` directory, run the command

`python generator.py shakespeare.txt`

## Example Output

```
python generator.py shakespeare.txt

I'll to my ghostly father's cell, His help to crave thy just and honourable?

What wrong is this imperial throne.

Where should I think we are ourselves, what things there are no part but with reverent hands; I kiss my parched lips And comfort you, my lord.

What, my gracious lord.

God be thanked for prevention, Which I disdaining scorn'd, and craved death Rather than so, my lord.
